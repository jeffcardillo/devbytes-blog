Simple game for arduino with LinkSprite LCD 16x2 display. I created this for my nephews to be a simple project they can play around with and modify when they come visit.

The game first shows a "splash screen" with some text. Then has a "menu mode" where a player can select a difficulty setting. Then a "game mode" where a player can "win" or "lose" the game.

The game itself displays a player's character that can be moved from one line to the other on the LCD screen. The object is to dodge the obstacles that come toward the player. 

See a [video of the gaming](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oX6Z890Zd2A) action!
