I'm currently taking a Cryptography course at Drexel University as part of my Master of Software Engineering degree. An assignment that I just completed was to create a general presentation to give to the class; my topic was on Shannon's Theorem for encryption key length.

The presentation itself is fairly short - I was targeting 10 minutes. It starts off with an introduction to what Shannon Security and Perfect Secrecy mean, introduces Shannon's Theorem for key length, discusses why key length is important for encryption, and concludes with what this means in practice.
