I came across some art by Dave Whyte, particularly this piece, and was inspired to write some code! At some point I&amp;rsquo;d love to build the whole piece in code, but I started thinking about ways to render a 3D looking cylinder on a 2D canvas. The solution I came up with is to manipulate simple shapes based on the periodic changes of sine and cosine functions over time.</description>

I created this project to do an instructional walkthrough of Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM), Data-binding and LiveData to fellow engineers at my workplace. I&amp;rsquo;m using TheMovieDB API to fetch interesting data and show beautiful movie posters in this demo.
A presentation file is available (presentation/MVVM with Data Binding.pdf) that covers the specified patterns above. Please note that the format of the workshop will have attendees begin with a starter project - most of the code in the project is available but the specific pattern code is omitted.</description>
