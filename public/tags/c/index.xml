Simple game for arduino with LinkSprite LCD 16x2 display. I created this for my nephews to be a simple project they can play around with and modify when they come visit.
The game first shows a &amp;ldquo;splash screen&amp;rdquo; with some text. Then has a &amp;ldquo;menu mode&amp;rdquo; where a player can select a difficulty setting. Then a &amp;ldquo;game mode&amp;rdquo; where a player can &amp;ldquo;win&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;lose&amp;rdquo; the game.</description>
