      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently taking a Cryptography course at Drexel University as part of my Master of Software Engineering degree. An assignment that I just completed was to create a general presentation to give to the class; my topic was on Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Theorem for encryption key length.
The presentation itself is fairly short - I was targeting 10 minutes. It starts off with an introduction to what Shannon Security and Perfect Secrecy mean, introduces Shannon&amp;rsquo;s Theorem for key length, discusses why key length is important for encryption, and concludes with what this means in practice.</description>
